Combines scripts for

- Writing board (set pod name)
- Teleporter (teleport to pod)
- status (hovertext horse status)
- List horses (similar to organiser / bundlebox list objects so we can view status from any location)

Master Menu:

- Lists all available "Pods" by name (remove the appended name - too long)

Then on choosing gives below options:

- Teleport (teleport menu)
- Set Text (asks which text to set -> submenu of all available - linked in the same way as teleporter) then -> (Writing menu - sets writing on prim text + name of _touched object_)
- Status Config -> (asks which text to set -> submenu of all available - linked in the same way as teleporter) then -> (status menu)
- See Status (lists the status of horses in this pod to chat / llowner im)

Requirements:

- when a new "pod" item is detected, scripts must be reset in all object (conserving the names, writing etc) so as to ensure all are up to date
