Example HTML files are attached:

The (paginated) list of bundles HTML
The row item click down.
We will save this information into supabase as we want to be able to sort and find bundle details - like specific traits.

Err on the side of collecting ALL data rather than making decisions on what is relevant.
Next we want a basic UI to search for any trait on.

We only really want one page so make it just a searchale table .

Create the requirements and architecture execution plan for this.
