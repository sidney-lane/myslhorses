The idea of this script is to lock all HORSE AND/OR Bundle objects (in the object properties tab) TO HELP PREVENT accidental deletion or return of horses.
It should
- only lock horse and or bundle objects (verified by their description string
- only lock salt, and consumable objects (verified by description string)


It should be menu driven and include
- start / stop / reset (script) buttons
- Unlock / Lock selections. followed by:
    - select: Lock Horses, Bundles, Consumables, All
    - lock/unlock by owner/group /all (maybe if possible)
    - list objects to lock (save it to linkset data maybe) 
    - Ask for user approval to lock/unlock the list (output to chat or similar)
- ? set range [or other way to find the objects to lock - parcel? land? owner? group?) (a range for locking NOTE: make sure you verify how many objects you can fetch within a range - otherwise a 96m range that does not get ALL objects in that range is useless)
