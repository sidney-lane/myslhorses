// This script will keep an array of "to-do" checklist items in linket memory and display them as hovertext on a HUD prim.
// It should be menu operated with ability to add and remove to-do checklist items in categories (each having a different prim, so a master script with prim scripts for writing)
// text can be coloured or turned on and off. Prim its in can be coloured or should be phantom and transparent if it has no items.
// menu should be able to start/stop/reset scripts
// it should have several different categories of "to-do items" - each having it's own hovertext and prim (in a linkset)
// it will display the to-do items using hovertext. ( and later v2 version to use the writing.lsl style - and alpha writing texture and mapping to letters.)
