Not finding all horses within range.
-> check sensor logic and range logic.
-> check distance measurements
-> check sensor "shape" (should be a circle -> or perhaps add the shape "type" to the menu if easy)
-> Ideally rez a particle field at the edge of the sensor field when setting range so its easy to see whats included
